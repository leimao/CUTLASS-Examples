# CuTe MMA Profiler

## Introduction

This application profiles various CuTe MMA (Matrix Multiply-Accumulate) configurations on NVIDIA GPUs. It measures the AI peak performance in TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) for different data types and layouts using NVIDIA Tensor Cores. Hopefully, this could help developers to reproduce the AI peak performance NVIDIA advertises for GPUs.
