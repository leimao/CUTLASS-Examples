# CuTe Matrix Transpose

## Introduction

These examples demonstrate the implementations of general matrix copy kernels using the CuTe. Each kernel does boundary checks and can be used for any matrix size.

Even though matrix copy can be treated as array copy in general, we did not do so in the implementations.
